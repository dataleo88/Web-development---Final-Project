                  Our experience with Green Thumb Landscaping was awesome! They
                  repaired our landscaping in St. Albert. Christopher Watson, in
                  particular, was professional, polite and hardworking. He
                  wanted to make sure we were happy with the job every step of
                  the way! Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well
                  done! Great job Christopher!

                  One time, they cut my lawn too short, it turned a bit brown,
                  but they've been good ever since.

                  I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks
                  Landscaping Limited for the incredible work they did for my
                  yard in the Newcastle area. Not only did the crew work
                  diligently to complete my yard in a timely fashion, they were
                  very nice and polite and went out of their way to ensure
                  everything that I asked for was done. They were extremely
                  patient with the issues raised regarding some of the
                  neighbours concerns. They were also always asking me if there
                  was anything more they could do which made me feel that they
                  genuinely wanted to do their best work. The landscaping crew
                  as a whole was beyond fantastic and extremely polite and
                  professional. In particular, I want to thank Matt & Jimmy (who
                  worked on the fence and deck) for being outstanding employees.
                  They not only fixed and addressed all of my concerns but they
                  went out of their way to make sure everything was completed at
                  a high standard. For example, I had mentioned a concern about
                  the grass (even though they were not the ones who put it in)
                  and the next day they brought new sod in and replaced the bad
                  parts. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Chad, as he
                  too went above and beyond to organize everything I asked for.
                  From putting up with all of my phone calls, to following up
                  with all my changes; he made sure our new yard and deck was
                  taken care of. I wanted to write this letter expressing how
                  much I appreciate all of the crew's hard work, and how
                  impressed I am with Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.

                  Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping
                  happen. I had no clue of how to set up my yard, but they came
                  and gave me an awesome plan and executed. The city had put
                  requirements on my property that needed to be met. I was
                  unsure on how to meet the requirements and stay within my
                  budget. After a brief meeting with a park representative they
                  had created a plan that to fulfill the requirements and had
                  booked a time to finish the job. A great thing when you are
                  spending so much money is to see the crew actually working
                  swiftly and not taking long breaks. Park's guys worked
                  straight until dark each day to finish the job. I would
                  totally recommend Green Thumb Landscaping to anyone. In fact,
                  I did recommend them to a neighbour down the street. He went
                  with Park because they were able to deliver a prompt and
                  professional service. Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a
                  job well done!

                  We were very impressed. We've done a lot of work to our home
                  and property and this has been by far one of the best
                  experiences! They met or exceeded expectations every step of
                  the way. The planning process was fun, the job started the day
                  we'd planned for and the crew was fantastic, working full days
                  until they were done, and touching base with me whenever there
                  were decisions to be made (no matter how minor). We had a
                  patio area put in for our fire pit, added walkways, pea gravel
                  and mulch to the surrounding area and they levelled the lawn
                  and put down new sod. The work was top notch. Even more
                  telling of the high level of professionalism is the care they
                  put into follow up. They've contacted us, come out to the
                  house to take a look after the fact and actually asked for
                  feedback to help them do better in the future. I wish all
                  companies cared about their craft as much as the team at Green
                  Thumb Landscaping Ltd. When we're ready to tackle the front
                  yard we will definitely be working with them again and we
                  would highly recommend them to others ðŸ™‚

                  Someone Toilet Papered my trees, they came and fixed it and

                  I was very happy with the professionalism and work completed
                  by the entire team from the moment we met Mike, to the
                  fantastic office staff and the team who completed the job on
                  site. It was a pleasure working with all of you and we are
                  happy with the finished product and the timely fashion the
                  work was completed. We were very happy with how our questions
                  or inquiries were dealt with so proficiently and
                  professionally by everyone.

                  I have used landscapers before and they are a very
                  professional group. They showed up on time, did fast work and
                  cleaned up after every day. They took the time to ask me
                  questions while ensuring what I wanted was completed. Great
                  job and I would recommend this company.

                  We are truly very pleased with the work your team has done on
                  our project. Not only were the guys and gals all very pleasant
                  and accommodating, they always cleaned up after themselves.
                  Anyone who has hired contractors to do work knows how uncommon
                  this trait is.
